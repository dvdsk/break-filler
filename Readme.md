Suggest activities to do during breaks. 

A popup will open shows any message you like during breaks enforced by [break-enforcer](https://github.com/evavh/break-enforcer). 

You can: 
 - specify a time window within which suggestions should occur. 
 - specify how many times they should be issued during the day. 
 - The suggestions will be spaced out as much as possible so they do not get repetitive. 
 - You can require ticking a checkbox marking a suggestion as done. 
 - When using the sway window manager you can tell break-filler to try to issue a popup when a specific window is visible. I use this to make it not bother me when I am watching a video.
